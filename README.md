# Algorithms
This repository contains some of the Python-based projects I wrote for my Algorithms course, taught in ENSEA in Cergy, France

# Skip List
This project implements a recursive data structure called a Skip List, similar to a linked list, except each node has variable amounts of pointers to other nodes.

# Three Partition
Three Partition uses a recursive memoization to efficiently determine if a set of values can be divided into three "bins" each with the same sum.
